# webhook-deleter

A simple web application that can delete Discord webhooks.

## Why?

- You can prevent unknown @everyone webhook spams
- Most scams on discord get your information by sending a link to the victim, grabbing the information from the webpage, and finally sending your data via a webhook. You can get that webhook url by going on your Developer Tools (record the Network), copy the webhook url and you can delete it from here.
